#Brief description
I'll update this description soon enough, atm I'm busy making this script work.
Long story short: I host a Project Zomboid server and I love automating stuff, therefore I'm creating this small util to help myself and other run all the following tasks:

1. start server;
2. stop server;
3. restart server;
4. reset server;
5. update mods;
6. create backup;
7. restore backup;
